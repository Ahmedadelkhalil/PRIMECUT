              Group of up to 20 can book online and will be automatically
              confirmed if we have the space. If you can’t see any space it is
              likely that we are fully booked, however we may be able to take
              walk-ins so please visit us. Bookings are open 3 months in
              advance.

            <p className="answer">
              To secure a booking on busy nights and large groups we do ask for
              card details in advance of the reservation. At the time of making
              the booking, your card will be authenticated for the amount of £10
              per person. We do not charge your card to book, we simply take the
              information in case of a no show and/or failure to cancel before
              our 48h cancellation period.

              IF I NEED TO CANCEL A BOOKING WILL I GET CHARGED?
            </p>
            <p className="answer">
              If your booking is for 1-5 you can cancel online and you will not
              be charged. If your booking with us is for 6 diners or larger our
              cancellation period is 48hrs and we reserve the right to charge
              the cancellation fee if the booking is cancelled within this time
              period. This may change over holiday or special occasion periods
              such as Christmas or boozy brunch bookings - so please make sure
              you check the individual terms and conditions when booking.
